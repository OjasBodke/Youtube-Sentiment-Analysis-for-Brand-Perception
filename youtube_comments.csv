Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way...",negative,23

26,0.046,0.767,0.186,0.9958,"Can I just say as a Samsung user for over 7 years now I've appreciated the tech that has been applied over the years.  Nothing has ever come close to samsungs cameras for photography for me.  I've always purchased the ultra as I wanted the best cameras but saying that I also like an aesthetically pleasing phone.  A phone that just feels good in the hand and comfortable to use.  My current phone is the s20 ultra.  I've never like the note series.  For that purpose I've not upgraded for 3 years because I don't want to downgrade on the cameras and I think the latest ultras are ugly and boxy.  Like holding a brick.  I did contemplate going with the 23+,  it looks amazing.  The rounded corners I love and also the flat sides and screen just makes it all the more pleasing to look at but then there's the cameras.  I'd be limited with what I can do so I've decided to continue on with the 20 ultra for now.  Six months down the like now since the 23 release and I've researched and watched a million reviews especially on camera comparison between the range.  If you made the plus with all the specs of the ultra then I'd be sold.  Not everyone likes those sharp edge corners,  hence why you had the notes for those who did.  Bring back the ultra with the smooth,  seemless rounded corners please,  I'm loving the flat screen as it looks nicer then the curved screen of the 20 ultra but please listen to all the comments in the hundreds of reviews so far about the ultra specs in the body of the plus.  I'll wait another 6 months to see what your going to do with the 24 range.  I will say so far though you've lost out in 2 years of upgrade sales from me alone,  others must feel the same.  I like a shiny new phone every Feb like the other Samsung fans,  I don't want to go another year without upgrading ",positive,26

It seems so big, but with all the new specs and camera upgrades I do think it is a good deal. I use my phone for social media, email and a lot of photos (nature mostly and family photos). My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+). A lot of you mention S22U as being a good phone (no doubt about that), but I cannot say the price makes a huge difference between both of them, and taking into account the upgrades S23U has, I think it is worth it.

44,0.092,0.759,0.149,0.9623,"my last Note was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, but even then I had so many problems with the hardware and software, the biggest issue was the overheating of the Li-ion (Lithium ion) battery. I am really glad I switched to Xiaomi with their safer Li-po (Lithium polymer) battery, not only it charges much quicker, it is a safer battery technology and I don't experience any overheating of the device, also Li-po batteries can't explode;) Even the chipset Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is much faster than Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on Galaxy phones because on Samsung it uses Samsung technology and on other phones it's TSMC technology which is way better and reliable! Samsung phones are copying Apple and are loosing features but not gaining and are only good and advertising. Not a 1 billion color display, not fast charging because of the Li-ion dangerous batteries, not the best camera, not the best chipset technology, not a charger in the box, not a case in the box. Li-po batteries are safer for the environment and is the way to safe our planet, not by removing the charger from the box, chargers can be recycled and create new charging bricks, not how Samsung is saying to go buying another package with a new charger and waste paper and trees, or as Samsung is saying to use your old charger which may be broken and with slower charging than your new Galaxy phone. The most important thing is using safer and environmental friendly battery technology which doesn't explode, doesn't heat up as much and can be charged faster!

46,0.048,0.895,0.057,0.4828,"The best way to shoot quality photos with the new Samsung Galaxy S32 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode and then scale down the size to 4000 x 3000 pixels (12MP, 4:3 aspect ratio) or crop the latter to 4000 x 2250 pixels (9MP, 16:9 ratio). This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9.

The main narrative was about the camera as if a device that is as versatile as a smartphone (being in many case almost as powerful as laptops nowadays) is used primarily and almost exclusively to create content on different levels. So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to.

Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time.
